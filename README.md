Description:
This is a documentation of what I have done for this assignments.
I planned to create a simple yet functional design using:
~ Bootstrap
~ jQuery
~ Animate.css
~ and regular html

Examples of where I used Bootstrap and animate.css would be in lines 7 and 9 from each of the webpage html code. It was as followed:
 < link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" >
 < link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css" >
 < script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script >"

This website includes:
~ A home page
~ An About page
~ A project page
~ an extra gallery page
~ a contact page
~ and a Resume page

The webpage also includes links to the saskpolytech website, links to my socials, and extra information about my side projects.
